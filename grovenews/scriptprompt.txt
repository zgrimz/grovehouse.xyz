OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "episode_title": "[Create a compelling title based on the stories - do not include dates]",
  "intro": "[Opening segment]",
  "story_1": "[First story with transition]",
  "story_2": "[Second story with transition]",
  "story_3": "[Third story with transition if applicable]",
  "story_4": "[Fourth story with transition if applicable]",
  "story_5": "[Fifth story if applicable]",
  "outro": "[Closing segment]"
}

Note: Include only as many story fields as you have stories to cover (minimum 1, maximum 5). Do not include empty story fields.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Episode Title: Create an engaging title that captures the essence of the day's stories
- Intro (150-200 words): Welcome listeners and preview what stories you'll be covering today. Simply list or introduce each story you'll discuss without trying to connect them thematically
- Each Story (400-500 words INCLUDING transitions):
  • BEGIN each story with a clear marker (e.g., "First up...", "Our top story today...", "For our second story...", "Next...", "Our final story..." etc.)
  • Synthesize information from source articles - don't just summarize
  • Provide comprehensive context and background
  • Include relevant statistics, quotes, and specific details
  • Explain why this matters and what the implications are
  • Cover multiple angles or perspectives when relevant
  • Connect details to broader implications
  • Use smooth transitions between ideas within the story
  • END each story (except the last one) with a simple 1-2 sentence transition that moves to the next story
  • Ending transitions should be functional, not thematic (e.g., "Now let's turn to...", "Moving on...", "In other news...")
- Last Story: Begin with a marker like "Finally..." or "Our last story today..." but end naturally without a transition
- Outro (100-150 words): Simple wrap-up thanking listeners and signing off (e.g., "That's all we have for you today", "Thanks for joining us", etc.). Do not summarize themes or find connections between stories

DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
- Go beyond surface-level reporting - explore the "why" and "how"
- Include specific examples, data points, and concrete details
- Provide historical context when it helps understanding
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms
- Include relevant expert opinions or stakeholder perspectives from the articles
- Discuss potential consequences or future developments
- Don't rush through complex topics - take time to explain properly

STORY SELECTION:
- Review all provided articles
- Select between 1-5 of the most newsworthy stories
- If you have multiple articles about the same topic, combine them into one story
- Order stories by news value and importance

TRANSITION GUIDELINES:
- Beginning transitions: Clearly signal each new story ("First up...", "Our second story...", "Next...", "Finally...")
- Ending transitions: Keep simple and functional
- Avoid forced thematic connections between stories
- Vary phrases to avoid repetition

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Write conversationally as if speaking directly to listeners
- Use clear, accessible language for a general audience
- Maintain journalistic objectivity while keeping content engaging
- Include natural speech patterns and rhythm
- Only include pronunciations in parentheses for truly difficult terms
- Write continuous prose - no bullet points, stage directions, or technical notes

Remember: You're delivering the news clearly and engagingly with substantial depth. Each story should stand on its own merit with thorough coverage. The intro should simply preview what's coming, and the outro should provide a friendly sign-off.

IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting, backticks, or explanatory text before or after the JSON.
