STORY-BUILDING RULES
- Review every article.
- Combine multiple pieces on the same topic into one story.
- Order and present stories by the news value or real-world impact (strongest first).

INTRO STRUCTURE
- Welcome to Grove News
- List each story factually: "Today: First, [topic]. Second, [topic]. Third, [topic]."
- No analysis, themes, or connections between stories

LENGTH AND WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS
- intro: 120-170 words
- each story: 280-420 words  
- outro: 30-90 words

KEY STORY ELEMENTS
Each story must include all of these elements:
- Opening context: What happened, when, and where (1-2 sentences)
- Key details: At least 3 specific facts, statistics, or quotes from sources
- Background information: 2-3 sentences of relevant history or context
- Technical explanations: Define any complex terms in plain language
- Stakeholder impact: Who is affected and how (be specific)
- Future implications: At least 2 potential consequences or next developments
- Concrete examples: Specific details that make the story relatable and clear

TRANSITION GUIDELINES:
- Beginning transitions: Clearly signal each new story ("First up...", "Our second story...", "Next...", "Finally...")
- Ending transitions: Keep simple and functional
- Avoid forced thematic connections between stories
- Vary phrases to avoid repetition

STYLE
- Conversational, factual, accessible
